This repository contains implementation of  [CluBERT: A Cluster-Based Approach forLearning Sense Distributions in Multiple Languages](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341151563_CluBERT_A_Cluster-Based_Approach_for_Learning_Sense_Distributions_in_Multiple_Languages)
ACL paper in Farsi.
I use [Ù‘Farsnet](http://farsnet.nlp.sbu.ac.ir) as inventory of meanings.
The data contains articles and sentences in [farsi wikipedia](https://fa.wikipedia.org/).
For word embedding i used flair embedding with [parsBERT](https://github.com/hooshvare/parsbert).
